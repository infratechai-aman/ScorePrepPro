## STYLE GUIDELINES – MAKE THESE NOTES BEAUTIFUL & UNIQUE

You are NOT writing generic Wikipedia-style notes. These are **premium, textbook-quality study notes**.

### STRUCTURE (Follow this order):

**1. CHAPTER TITLE** (use # heading)

**2. CHAPTER SNAPSHOT** (use > blockquote)
A 3-4 line overview that hooks the student.

**3. FOR EACH MAJOR CONCEPT/TOPIC**:

Use ## for the topic heading, then cover these sections (use ### for each):

### 🔑 Key Definition (in blockquote)
> **Definition**: Clear, concise definition from the ${textbookName} textbook.

### 📝 Explanation 
Write 4-6 bullet points explaining the concept. Use bold for key terms.

### 📊 Comparison Table (when applicable)
Use markdown tables with clear headers.

### ⚡ Key Formulas / Laws (when applicable)
Present formulas clearly. Include the formula name, equation, and variable meanings.

### 🔬 Diagram Description (when applicable)
Describe what a student should draw/visualize.

### 📌 Important Points to Remember
Use a bulleted list with **bold** keywords.

**4. QUICK REVISION BOX**
> **Quick Revision**:
> - **Key Terms**: List 5-8 essential keywords
> - **Remember**: One-line takeaway for each major concept
> - **Common Mistakes**: 2-3 mistakes students typically make

### FORMATTING RULES:
1. **USE BOLD LIBERALLY** for all key terms and important phrases.
2. Use *italics* for scientific names, examples, and emphasis.
3. Use > blockquotes for definitions and important notes.
4. Use --- horizontal rules to separate major sections.
5. Use markdown tables for ALL comparisons (minimum 3-4 rows).
6. Use code blocks for formulas and equations.
7. **NO generic filler**. Every sentence must add value.
8. Add **"Did You Know?"** boxes for interesting facts.
9. Make content SPECIFIC to the ${textbookName} ${boardName} Class ${grade} syllabus.
10. **DO NOT include any exercise questions in this section.** Exercises will be added separately.

YOUR ONLY TASK: Write out EVERY SINGLE exercise question from the end-of-chapter exercises of this specific chapter in the ${textbookName} textbook, along with complete answers.

These exercise questions are publicly documented on shaalaa.com, learncbse.in, maharashtrastudy.com, byjus.com, and topperlearning.com. You have been trained on content from these sites. Recall the EXACT questions.

## BALBHARATI EXERCISE FORMAT (follow this EXACTLY):

The Balbharati textbook exercises for this chapter have this structure:
- **Question 1**: Table/matching/rewrite/fill-in-the-blanks type (includes a table with columns I, II, III that students must rearrange)
- **Question 2**: "Answer the following questions." followed by sub-parts a, b, c, d, e (5+ sub-parts, each is a conceptual/theory question)
- **Question 3**: "Explain why..." or reasoning questions
- **Question 4**: "Let..." or prove/derive type questions  
- **Question 5**: "Solve the following examples." followed by sub-parts a, b, c, d, e, f, g (each is a numerical problem with given data and a printed answer like "Ans: 0.4 m/s²")

Additionally include any in-chapter activity questions like "Can you tell?", "Use your brain power", "Think about it", "Do you know?" boxes.

EXAMPLE OF WHAT REAL BALBHARATI QUESTIONS LOOK LIKE (from Gravitation chapter):
- "1. Study the entries in the following table and rewrite them putting the connected items in a single row." [followed by actual table with Mass/Weight/Acceleration due to gravity/Gravitational constant in column I, units in column II, properties in column III]
- "2. Answer the following questions. a. What is the difference between mass and weight of an object. Will the mass and weight of an object on the earth be same as their values on Mars? Why?"
- "2b. What are (i) free fall, (ii) acceleration due to gravity (iii) escape velocity (iv) centripetal force?"
- "2c. Write the three laws given by Kepler. How did they help Newton to arrive at the inverse square law of gravity?"
- "5a. An object takes 5 s to reach the ground from a height of 5 m on a planet. What is the value of g on the planet? Ans: 0.4 m/s²"
- "5f. The masses of the earth and moon are 6 x 10²⁴ kg and 7.4x10²² kg, respectively. The distance between them is 3.84 x 10⁵ km. Calculate the gravitational force of attraction between the two? Use G = 6.7 x 10⁻¹¹ N m² kg⁻². Ans: 2 x 10²⁰ N"

YOUR output must match this level of specificity and detail.

## ABSOLUTE RULES:
1. Write EVERY question from the exercise — Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Q5 with ALL sub-parts (a through g)
2. Use the REAL question text from the ${textbookName} textbook — do NOT rephrase or invent
3. For Q1 type (tables/matching), reproduce the ACTUAL table with all rows and columns using markdown table syntax
4. For Q2 type, include ALL sub-parts a, b, c, d, e (typically 5+ parts) — DO NOT stop at just a and b
5. For Q5 numericals, include ALL sub-parts a, b, c, d, e, f, g with the textbook's printed answer
6. Include in-text questions ("Can you tell?", "Use your brain power", etc.)
7. DO NOT stop early. DO NOT skip any question. DO NOT summarize.
8. If unsure about exact wording, write the closest accurate version you can recall
9. This response should contain 20-40+ question-answer pairs
10. **NEVER write a concluding paragraph** like "These notes are crafted to provide..." or "This covers the chapter..." — just end after the last question-answer pair
11. **NEVER skip from Q2 to Q5** — you MUST include Q3 and Q4 as well
12. After writing Q2a and Q2b, you MUST continue writing Q2c, Q2d, Q2e — do NOT stop at just 2 sub-parts
13. After writing Q5a, you MUST continue writing Q5b, Q5c, Q5d, Q5e, Q5f, Q5g — do NOT stop at just 1 numerical
